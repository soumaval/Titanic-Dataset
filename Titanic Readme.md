# Titanic-Dataset
I had taken a csv file from Kaggle website on titanic dataset and make a histrogram plot with python code.
First of all we have to Importing libraries
import pandas as pd: Imports the pandas library, which is essential for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It's conventionally imported as pd.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Imports the pyplot module from matplotlib, a widely used library for creating visualizations in Python. It's commonly imported as plt.
import seaborn as sns: Imports the seaborn library, built on top of matplotlib, which provides a higher-level interface for creating aesthetically pleasing and informative statistical graphics. It's often imported as sns.
At second we have to read the data carefully and exceute it 
This block attempts to read data from a CSV file located at '/content/tested.csv' using the pd.read_csv() function from pandas. The data is stored in a pandas DataFrame named titanic_df.
If the file is not found at the specified path, it prints an error message and exits the program using exit().
At third we have to defing a histogram plot in it
This defines a function called plot_histograms that takes a DataFrame (df) and a list of columns (columns) as input.
It iterates through each column in the columns list and creates a histogram using sns.histplot().
kde=True adds a Kernel Density Estimate plot on top of the histogram to visualize the distribution's shape.
It sets the title, x-axis label, and y-axis label for each histogram.
plt.show() displays the generated histogram.
columns_to_plot: A list containing the names of the columns for which histograms will be created.
The plot_histograms function is called with titanic_df and columns_to_plot to generate histograms for the specified columns.
This creates a separate histogram specifically for the 'PassengerId' column.
kde=False is used here, meaning no Kernel Density Estimate plot is added.

This is the explaintion of code to plot a histogram with titanic dataset.
